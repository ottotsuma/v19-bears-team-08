## Our Project Idea

A dashboard for [Chingu](https://www.chingu.io/) members that contains everything one might need to look up or manage their account/membership

## Workflow

Since our team consists of two members with slightly different goals, we've decided to separate the front and back end folders and work independently, but towards the same weekly goals.

## MVP

A basic dashboard with authentication and tabs to view Chingu's static information with the ease to add further tabs to meet/exceed our stretch goals

## Stretch Goals/Tabs

- when2meet for groups
- checkin capabalities
- jira board
- project submission
- dynamic roadmap
- admin/mod area
- settings area
